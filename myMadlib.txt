there lived a dogs.  This dogs
liked to eat hot dogs, but the jungle had
very little hot dogs to offer.  One day, an
explorer found the dogs and discovered

dogs back to jersey, where it could
eat as much hot dogs as it wanted.  However,
the dogs became homesick, so the
explorer brought it back to the jungle,
leaving a large supply of hot dogs.
